I am not sure what I should write here. This is a personal site where I noted down things that interests me. It could be anything or everything I learn from my humble experiences.

Writing was one of my interests too, especially if it is about stories and memories that I have made over the years. Regardless it was a good time or a bad time, I surely have learned something.

Finally, growth to me is not about the age, it is rather the colorful experiences that garnered over our lifetime. Have fun!
