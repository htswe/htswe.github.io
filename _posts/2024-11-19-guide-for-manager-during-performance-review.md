### Introduction

Year end is around the corner. And it means "annual performance review". Your HR has a short briefing on the process this year (hopefully, it is not much different from last year). You and your team start to get busy, the timelines are usually tight. And now, it is about time to have a one on one chat for the review.

Where do you start? How do you go about it? For a new manager, this could be daunting. I hope this article could help you with it.

### Start early and do harder ones first

You won't do an effective job at handling all the advice below if you start late on this. Too many leaders with large teams write all their performance reviews on the same day in a short period of time. Rather, take the time to think through what you will write (and later say) and how you plan to communicate it. Also, do the hardest reviews first – this will help clear your mind and also keep you from stressing about difficult reviews throughout the process.

### If you need to, practice

Many reviews won't require practice in advance, but at least some will. Practice giving tough feedback and having difficult conversations with a neutral party (not another employee, of course). Tap into help from a peer, leader, or human resources professional who can help.

### Don't bring surprises (and if you have to, give people time to save face)

Feedback should be coming from you **regularly** during the review period. If there is something negative that shows up on the performance review, the person you are reviewing should already have been hearing about it from you for awhile and had a chance to begin working on it. When this isn't possible (due to leadership transitions) give people time to absorb negative feedback and save some face before attempting to have a constructive conversation.

### Balance the conversation appropriately

If the person you are reviewing is doing great work in 95% of their duties, don't spend half the time talking about the 1-2 areas where they are lacking. Save that conversation for another time to go into more detail.

Likewise, if a person is seriously under performing in a major of their work, then don't try to find positive things to talk about to balance out the bad news – your time giving feedback needs to accurately reflect the work they are doing.

### Give specific examples

You aren't credible on your praise if the best you can say is “good job” and you don't give people a path to correct themselves if critical feedback only suggests a “needs improvement.” People need to know specifically what they are doing well so they can repeat and specifically where to make changes to be more in alignment with great performance. Plus, you build trust with people when you cite specific examples. Agree or not, at least they know you care enough to pay attention.

### Hold your ground

During the review conversation is not the time to be making changes to what you are communicating (thus the importance of "Start early and do harder ones first"). Decide on your message in advance and stick to it. A mixed message based upon strong feedback from the other party only serves to make the conversation more complicated and sending a different message than you intended. If you've had a hard time holding your ground in the past, you need to practice in advance. See "If you need to, practice".

### Avoid talking about others not present

You are reviewing one person at a time, not the entire team. Be sure your feedback focuses on the person at hand and doesn't veer into an inappropriate conversation about what others are or are not doing in their development. If you need to speak about others for the purpose of examples, stick to the facts and not your opinions or feedback about their development.

### Conclusion

In summary, we explore how we could execute the performance review for both you and your team. We all want to do our best for ourselves and our teammates. Following those guides will help you to sail smoother in the performance reviews, and of course, "Practice makes perfect".
