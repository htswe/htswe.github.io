## Intro

This is gonna be long, so I am going to warn you. Firstly, if you think crypto is a scam, then leave. If you are going to laugh at other people misery, you should leave too. If you are looking for what crypto coin to invest or how to invest, then leave as well. This article is to remind myself and reflect on what I did wrong or I should have done, so as not to repeat the same mistakes in the future. If you are still keen, read on.

## Storm

Time is May 9th, 2022. Everything seem going fine - a bit of good and bad news around the world. And then the storm comes without the warning - UST (Terra USD), a stable coin with the market value of US 18 billion dollars, dropped its value from 1 USD to 70 cents. It was then quickly recover to 90 cents. It significantly increased the confidence and believed that it will come back to $1 once things are more stable. Then hell broke, it dropped all the ways to 30 cents!!! Alright, it was over, right? No, it came back to 80 cents again. Oh my, are we going to survive? Then it dropped to 60, then 50, 40, 30 and then there was no coming back. People called it a bank run where everyone rushed to take out their money. It was a rollercoaster (I hate rollercoaster) ride with a front seat. Scary and dramatic - as the time and day went by, I was watching the chart with disbelief. What was going on? Who did it? Why did it? A lot of rumours, twitter posts, telegram chats, reddit discussions and youtubers - everywhere and everyone is talking about the founder, Terra Luna and UST. I clearly remember that I was feeling all the emotions, fear, uncertainty, hope and confidence are coming in and out, moving up and down. It was so tiring, so so tiring.

And here is the worst part - to tell family that I have lost a significant amount of money in this stable coin collapse.

## When dust are settled

> There are five stages of grief - _denial_, _anger_, _bargaining_, _depression_ and _acceptance_.
> <cite><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-death-and-dying/oclc/4238">Elisabeth KuÌˆbler-Ross, On _Death and Dying_ in **1969**.</a></cite>

Now I am probably in stage 4 or stage 5. I thought I have accepted the result of my poor decisions after speaker with my family. But it still comes back to hurt us when we are spending some money in everyday. Hopefully, with this article, I could reach to the last stage of grief and then move on. As things are over, it is time to do some reflections - why I did what I did and what could be been done differently.

## Why I invest in UST

![ust](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NQsDZz1XgwOik3PpejCALQ.png)

Looking back, I was a careful person. Even though I heard about astounding 20% APY (annual interest) for UST in Anchor Protocol about 6 months ago, I was not rushing to get in. In fact, I doubted it so much that I chose to ignore. Meanwhile, terra ecosystem grew so much. I threw in about $100 in anchor protocol for a month to understand about the products and the platform. After 2 months, I am convinced that even if 20% APY is not achievable in long term, terra ecosystem is very interesting space to watch.

Most of my fund at the time were locked in USDC (another stable coin with 50 billions USD in market) in CEX (Central Exchange). Even thought the interest are not as high as UST in Anchor Protocol, I could live with it. And then the cut came in the early apr and may, a lot CEX started to cut down their interest rates for stable coins across the industry.

Thus, I started looking around for the fund to convert the USDC. Meanwhile, for UST,

- It became top 5 in the entire cryptocurrency market with 18 billion and
- It has been through the up and down turns since 2020
- It was tested once when it dropped to 85 cents, but it recovered and even grew stronger.
- A big developer community and the ecosystem has a lot of growing good applications
- Almost every crypto veterans out there think highly of Terra ecosystems.
- And of course, a very strong backing from VC and large investment firms too.

### Fiat is slow death

After covid, people face another big threat - **Inflation** in 2022. Everything was expensive with food shortage, war and covid lock-down in major economy like China. Our $1 cannot buy the same thing as 2021. It is 8%-10% more expensive. Our earning was not catching up. The money in our bank will be eaten by the inflation monster slowly, but surely. Stock markets around the world are also seeing the correction. Netflix dropped 75% from last year. Good companies like Tesla, Facebook, Google, Apple, all those big tech companies are facing the sell-off as well. It doesn't seem like a good decision to convert USDC to Fiat.

### Other alternative like DeFi staking and Liquidity Provider

There are some others high returns product in crypto DeFi world. However, it also comes at a price that the investment will be exposed to the volatility and market trend of the particular crypto currency. It won't suit my need of finding a stable income with stable value.

With those thoughts in mind, I moved about $20k of USDC to UST a week before the crash happened.

## Lesson 1: Stable is not stable

![balance](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1055081/pexels-photo-1055081.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb)

During this period, I come to realize that the stable coin in crypto is not the kind of stable. Although the pegging of $1 needs to be done, there are always a risk. If the stable coin is issued by a central authority (eg. USDC, USDT), then the risk is about what happened when the price falls below $1. How quickly the $1 peg come back? Are the collateral (eg. cash in bank or short term bonds) be easily liquidated and supply back into the market? for UST, it was algorithmic stable coin and relied on the confidence of the community/backers. When the price falls to a sudden level, no one will catch the falling knife and come into rescue. It is always to find out what backs the stable coin and how the company behind will react.

## Lesson 2: DYOR (Do your own research)

I spent a good amount of times to understand the project or the coin. I tired understanding about the team, the tokenomic (how the tokens are distributed) and the community who believe and support the project. UST was one of the greatest projects. Even though there is a depegging risk, it was hard to imagine, especially for the project who is in Top 5 worldwide cryptocurrency. I lacked to imagine for the worst case and its contingency plan hence I didn't know what to do for a few days.

## Lesson 3: Exit Plan

![exit](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1871343/pexels-photo-1871343.jpeg)

Remember fire drill - even thought we hate it, as for safety, we exercised two fire drill a year. We repeat the same fire drill every year, listening to the same alarm and instructions, and then, move on to escape from the imaginary fire in an orderly manner. We did it so many times so that our body will automatically know how to react upon the siren of fire alarm (before fire drill or the actual fire). For UST, I didn't have the exit plan. I didn't know what to do when it happened. I searched through the internet and listened to the some crypto veterans for the advice. I watched on the twitter about how the founder/team and their official twitter account posting how it is planning to fix it. Instead, I should have prepare for a set of instruction so that I could have cut the loss and pull back the majority of the fund.

## Emotional Challenge

Although we all know that we could earn back what we have lost as long as we are still employed, it will ink in our memory for lifetime. Time shall heal all the pains of losing, but will never be forgotten. Glad that it crashed early too, otherwise, more money might have been poured in and lose even more.

## Down, but not Out

After this unforgettable event, I asked myself if I give up on crypto currency as a whole. The market will be bearish and full of bad news one after another. But no, I am not going to stop now. I will continue to improve on my strategy, risk assessment and the emergency exit plan. I believe that the failures like Terra will pave the way for a better product or company in the future. Others will learn from it and will build more resilient and better future. Crypto is not going away. The adaption of crypto currency is growing as time goes on. More governments are also looking into crypto currency as assets to counter their countries financial challenges. More legalization are updating or putting into place, in order to protect the general public investors like you and me. Nothing could stop the advancement of technology. There is a demand for decentralized currency whether you like it or not. I will slow down on investment in crypto as I need to refill my bullets.

## Alternatives

If it were repeated, will I do things differently? Absolutely. First of all, I would be setting alerts once my risk tolerance threshold is reached. I would sell some and cut the losses along the way. Information is important to receive it timely, but not via someone or an influencer. Should go directly to the official channels.

I also found out that there are opportunities when the market crashed like that too. People who [shorted][short-selling] the LUNA made handsome profits too. It is speculation and of course, carries some risks. But knowing that it is going downhill without 99.99% certainty, such knowledge will allow to grab the opportunity.

## Summary

![rainbow](https://images.pexels.com/photos/830829/pexels-photo-830829.jpeg)

Nothing in life is certain. We all live with different level of risks. In the time like this, staying alive is the most important and the main key to survive the storm is having the regular income. When time is tough, we have to keep good income, cut unnecessary expenses and live below our means. Discipline is very important in both good and hard times. Lastly, I want to share about being "rich". I love this definition - "you stay the place that you belong, live with people you care and do the work that you love. To me, this is rich.".
