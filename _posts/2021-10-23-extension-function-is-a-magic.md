This is one of my most favorite features of Kotlin - **Extension Function**. Imagine this. You are using a 3rd party library - String that have all the things that I would need for text manipulation- _almost_. If I have another one or two functions under `String` topic, Extension Function would solve this problem beautifully.

Kotlinâ€™s _extension functions_ effectively add member functions to existing class.

```kotlin
fun String.addGreetingEmoji() = "Hi $this ðŸ‘‹"
"Dave".addGreetingEmoji() // Hi Dave ðŸ‘‹
```

You can also apply extension function to your own class.

```kotlin
class Team(public val name: String)

fun Team.intro(noOfPeople: Int) = "$name team has $noOfPeople."

fun main() {
  val team = Team("Man Utd")
  println(team.intro(11)) //Man Utd team has 11.
}
```

Note that the extension function `Team.intro` can access to name in `Team` class. If the `name` is `private`, the extension function couldnâ€™t access from the extension function.

For extension function, you can rewrite Team.intro(Int) into `intro(Team, Int)`. The only reason for using extension function is the syntax. This is called _syntax sugar_, which is cleaner and more powerful.
