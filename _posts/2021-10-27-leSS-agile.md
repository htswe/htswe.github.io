### Purpose of Software Development

1. To solve a customer’s problem, not writing code
2. Need constant feedback (eg. testing, customer’s feedback)
   Waterfall methodology never work.

### Small organization becomes larger

Many companies starts from an idea, a bunch of people working together. They tried it in the market, many failed. Some manages to survive and get successful. The successful small company starts hiring people, later found out nothing delivered after some times. What happened next? The company hires managers - project managers. If delivered but have a lot of issues in customers, then the company will hire more QA. But customers said it is not the product they want. The company will start hire business analyst or someone who understand more about markets.

The root cause is to find out why the engineers cannot stick to the timeline instead of making organization larger.

> Optimizing locally is much better than optimizing overall.

This is the difference between a FinTech startup and a bank - organization complexity.

Will switching to “Agile” solve this problem?

> No. If you want different results, you will need a different system. The main point is to make things more simpler, not more complex system.

Traditional large groups are complicated - though not because they need to be, but they make illusion that it is necessary.

### Optimizing goal of an organization

1. To deliver the highest business value
2. Ability to adapt - what important today might not be important tomorrow. It doesn’t mean it is delivered. It means sooner than later.
3. learning organization - really optimized for learning. The team output is equal to the knowledge. The more the team learns, the more the team can deliver the goals.

### LeSS overview

Fixing Taylorism.

> There is no question that the cost of production is lowered by separating the work of planning and the brain work as much as possible from manual labour
