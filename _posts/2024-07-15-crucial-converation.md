### Worst manager

"You know what? You are the worst manager. Throughout my career, my managers have always thought highly of me. I think the issue is with you and your personal issues." I held my breath; my stomach hurt. It hurt from within. I tried to breathe in and out carefully. I tried opening my mouth, but the words choked up and didn't come out. "Everyone here is doing the same. I think you are picking on me. Seriously, it is YOUR issue, your personal issues." Someone from my team angrily accused me during the conversation and then threatened, "I have noticed many times and have been recording all your flaws all the time. I think you are not a good manager." The accusation continued, "The reason why you cannot answer my previous questions on why you never do those things is the reason for your bad management." Trust me, while writing this blog down, my stomach still hurts thinking about it.

### What happened?

I have a teammate who initially performed really well early in the year, but slowly started to underperform and not meet expectations. Work is delivered, but with a lot of follow-ups, and the quality has become questionable. As a team leader, instead of off-loading my responsibility, I took on the burden myself. I even tried doing some of the work to show how it should be done, but this was unappreciated and I was accused of micromanaging. I decided to take a chance and blindly trust that the person would find ways to deliver. Some initiatives were shown, but after six months, there were no results to justify this trust. The teammate is seriously still stuck where they began.

While asking for feedback about the person, there were shortfalls in the results delivered. Expectations were not fully met, especially from key stakeholders. My manager also shared some concerns about the progress and the plan for moving things around, particularly since we have high hopes for top-paid employees. It is not meeting expectations.

My mind flashed back. We have regular 1:1 meetings and interactions at least during standup. I see other people opening and closing user stories, but the work this person is on doesn't move much. Day after day, update after update. I tried to gently nudge them about "incremental small delivery" and being "more responsive and active" in the remote environment, but it hasn't borne fruit.

In the back of my mind, I hope my teammate will realize it and ask for feedback on how to improve. But in all the 1:1 meetings, the person comes in with nothing to discuss, shows no interest in company products or objectives, and just engages in a 30-minute chit-chat about their family.

### Nice vs Kind

![image-center](https://jellyjules.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/img_0497.jpg)

In my opinion, it is easier to be "nice." We can pretend, under the theory that we are focusing on the good things about our team. But we know it is only half the truth. Many team leaders suffer greatly from being nice or appearing to be "nice." We stop at "helping our teammates" whereas the actual goal is "helping our teammates to achieve the organization's goals."

I am also guilty of this. My personality, since I was young, preferred a harmonious relationship with people I come across. I chose to ignore the downsides. As a result, it often backfired, leading to a lot of unhappiness. When expectations do not meet reality, disappointments arise. These disappointments started to pile up, making me wonder if I should quit being a manager.

Then I realized that I had not been completely honest with the team. This was a disservice to the people who chose to trust me. I decided to become a kind manager instead.

### How it went

Instead of ignoring the shortfalls, I decided that it was time to engage in a feedback dialogue and be more transparent about my expectations. Did it go well? Not really. Here are some backstories and how it went.

#### Backstory 1

> It started on Thursday. The person communicated with the team about the work delivered. The team asked for something to confirm that it was working as intended. However, the person said it needed login access and that it would take a while. Some teammates suggested checking screenshots or logs instead, but the person insisted on getting the login access. The team didn't want to press the issue and let it slide. I felt the answer was not very satisfying, so I approached the teammate who had asked the person during the meeting if the answer was acceptable. The teammate played nice and said maybe the question wasn't very clear to the person. I knew it was my duty to let the person know.

There were other issues (details below) before our 1:1 call on Monday afternoon. In fact, over these three days, I had three issues to address.

When I was on the call, I told the person directly that I had some observations to discuss and jumped right into the first issue. The call was remote, and the person’s camera was off.

> I requested that the person turn on the camera, it has been sometimes, but I skipped on this as it was not my main intention for the day.

I shared my screen and pasted the first issue from my notes into our 1:1 document. I wanted to have a light conversation. I was very nervous and didn't start well enough to make the person feel safe. I was too eager to finish it, and as expected, it went downhill. The person disagreed with my assessment and began attacking the conversation itself. The person suggested that we should involve that teammate to clarify things. I maintained that it was my assessment and that I also felt the same personally.

> I didn't want to complicate matters with someone who was not on the call.

The person questioned why I hadn’t pressed him during the meeting if things were confusing. The situation turned against me, and I was shocked. I had no immediate answer and stumbled. I said things such as people may have other things to do, so people didn’t press the issue. The person was not happy with this response and continued to blame others for not clarifying further. He pressed me on why I hadn't clarified the issue, shifting the fault onto me.

Another attack followed: the person said it was my duty (as a team lead or manager) to take notes and share them for every meeting. He said if I had done this, there would be no confusion. While he was attacking me, I regained my composure.

I wrote down the actions he mentioned in the 1:1 notes on the screen.

1. We should clarify until we understand each other during the call.
2. We should take notes when questions are asked.
3. We should verify if the other party understands our answers.
I asked, "So these are the actions we will take to address the issue?" The person paused and said, "No, you should take the notes for every standup." I replied, "No, I have no intention of taking notes. It is a team standup. Unless the team agrees, we won’t take notes." The person responded, "Then drop it." So we ended up with two actions. I asked if he is okay with these two actions.

#### Backstory 2

Quickly, I jumped into issue 2.

> On that same Thursday, when I wanted to discuss the previous issue, the person replied on Slack: "I am doing my AWS course. Text me instead, please." I responded that I needed to have a call to minimize miscommunication. I then pasted my notes about issue 2 onto the screen: "You were busy with your course and not able to accommodate a call. This affects our work communication and ability to work with you."

Emotions were running high again, and I was now accused of picking on him.

He said everyone in the team does this. Some team leads also didn't reply to him for hours or days. He compared his situation to other teammates from different teams, claiming they do the same, and it was clear I was personally picking on him. He said if there was an issue, it was mine, and it was my personal issue for having these expectations. I was sad that the conversation had shifted from "helping him" to reaching a "point of no return." He kept talking, often referring back to previous issues and questioning why I hadn't answered them. He called me a bad manager and accused me of not seeing his value. He insisted he was the best employee based on feedback from many of his previous managers. He told me to stop doing this kind of thing to him or anyone else.

> I didn't engage to his accusation nor his questions. I let him finish expressing his emotions. It felt like peeling off a wound. I felt sad; his words were hurtful. I sensed no respect or willingness to work with me. The pain continued, but I remained calm and professional. I kept reminding myself that it was not easy to take in and talk about these issues.

When things started to slow down, I said that he seemed very defensive and asked if he still wanted to continue the dialogue. This calmed him down.

Meanwhile, I kept the 1:1 notes open, of course, not recording all the accusations and attacks, as those were emotional outbursts and not helpful. 

> Many times during the one-hour call, I felt like stopping the meeting, but I was glad that I didn’t end it.

I brought the issue back up and asked what we could do to address it.

He now chose to remain silent. He murmured that there wasn’t much to do. I pointed out that AWS is not our main focus for our team. He remained quiet and said it was on his calendar, and I should see the calendar. This again raised another issue, but I need to get this issue sorted it out first. He insisted that I should tell him directly if something is urgent or important, claiming he is always available when critical issues arise. I pulled out the Slack messages we exchanged and went over our communication again, asking what I should have done if the communication was important.

After a long silence, I suggested that I specify in the text if something is important, and he agreed.

#### Backstory 3

Now, I took a long, deep breath. Forty-five minutes had passed. I copied over the last item.

> On Friday, we had a production issue with the Android app. I texted around 9:30 a.m. (my local time) asking for some business information. I didn't get a response until 11 a.m. I explained that not responding in a timely manner delayed our response and affected our users. I asked what happened and why there was a delay.

The person said he had just woken up at 9:30 a.m. (my local time) and needed to do some childcare before starting work. This contradicted his previous claim of "always being there when there is a critical issue." He justified it by saying this was an exception.

I pressed on this point and asked how to communicate during critical times like this. I also reminded him that my message had been seen, based on his previous explanation. Then I asked how people would know that he had seen the issue but was unable to attend to it at the moment.

> The person tried to justify again by mentioning family commitments. I continued to focus on the importance of timely communication while acknowledging that everyone has family commitments.

The person didn't want to commit to any specific action. So I wrote down that the current communication method was considered the best and asked if that was what I should record.

In the end, the person suggested that he would send an acknowledgment if he couldn't attend to the issue immediately.

### Conclusion

It was really tiring and painful. That one hour was one of the hardest conversations I've ever had. If given a chance, I wouldn't want to repeat it. Was it delivered well? Maybe not. I think there are many areas that could be improved. After some rest, I felt much better about having had this conversation. While I hope the person can reflect on these issues, it could be an opportunity to turn things around and work better with him. Like many relationships, when trust is shaken so severely, it's challenging to go back to where we were. If the person manages to turn things around, we could emerge with a stronger relationship. Otherwise, if bad news were to come, it wouldn't be a surprise to the person.

By being considerate, I may choose to remain silent on these matters while taking note of them. However, I will not confidently recommend the person for career advancement or as my replacement. Nor will I trust the person to handle important tasks. I may keep the person until he becomes frustrated with stagnating in the same position for many years and decides to quit.

I understand some people might disagree with my approach. This is my one-sided story of how I saw things unfold. I know the person feels upset, probably angry at me for addressing these issues. However, my conscience is clear. If other teammates do this under my leadership, I will handle it in the same manner. There's nothing personal or biased in my actions.

Some takeaways from this experience:

1. Don't wait until it's too late. Address performance issues promptly, even with good performers.
2. Some senior engineers really lack soft skills and often make assumptions. This worsens when they under-perform but assume they are above average while not meeting expectations.
3. Do your homework. Gather facts (when, who, what, how).
4. You'll be tempted to deflect or answer questions. This could backfire (as it did initially for me). Stay calm and focused on your objectives. As a manager, there's a power imbalance, but don't abuse it. Listening and documenting are sufficient to drive the conversation.
5. People may respond with violence or silence. Stay engaged. If unsure, refrain from speaking. Listen and think hard on how to proceed.
6. Don't hesitate to suggest taking a break if the person can no longer continue the discussion. Ensure your calendar is organized.
Create a safe environment (which I didn't do well in this conversation; there's room for improvement).
Take notes. This helps slow down and gives you time to think.
Have a mentor to support you, especially during tough times and difficult conversations like this one.

### Appendix - crucial conversation approach

1. **State the fact**: Last Friday, we had a production issue that required immediate response. I sent a message to you at 9:30 AM asking for some information, but I didn't receive any reply until 11 AM.

2. **Tell the story**: I believe this caused a delay in our response and affected many users in our business.

3. **Invite them to share their story**: Could you please tell me what happened on that day from your perspective?

4. **Listen and stay on topic**: Allow the person to explain their side, whether defensive, critical, or suggesting solutions. It is easy to get away from the topic. Redirect to the topic.

5. **Record action**: If you identify actions they could have taken, write them in the shared document.

6. **Agree on the action**: Summarize their action points and ensure they acknowledge the list.

7. **Ensure safety**: Thank them for their time and suggestions, and assure them that we can revisit the discussion if necessary.
