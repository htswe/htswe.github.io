What is `Nothing` in Kotlin? Does it even exist? A `Nothing` return type indicates a function that never returns. This is usually a function that always throws an exception.

Here is an example.

```kotlin
fun infinity(): Nothing {
  while (true) {}
}
```

As you can see, we are planning to loop forever. Hence it will only make sense if we tell the caller that we shall return `Nothing`. `Nothing` is a built-in Kotlin type with no instances. In our codebase, there is one function we do it very often. Yes, `TODO()` which has a return type of `Nothing` and throws `NotImplementedError` when it is invoked.

```kotlin
fun willDoLater() = TODO()
fun willDoLaterWithCustomMsg = TODO("later, ok?")

willDoLater() // will return "NotImplementedError: An operation is not implemented."
willDoLaterWithCustomMsg() // will return "NotImplementedError: An operation is not implemented: later, ok?"
```

### Cousins of `Nothing`

We could also assign both `null` or `none` to a `var` or `val` of a nullable type. This is allowed because the type of both `null` and `none` is `Nothing?` (nullable `Nothing`).

```kotlin
val a: Nothing? = null
var b: String? = null
b = "abc"
b = none
print(b) // null
```
