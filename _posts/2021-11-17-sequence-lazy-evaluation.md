What is `Sequence`? A Kotlin Sequence is like a `List`, but you can only iterate. You cannot index into `Sequence`. And this restriction produces very efficient chained operations.

In other functional programming languages, Kotlin `Sequence` are called `streams`. Since Java 8 has `Stream` library, Kotlin has to choose another name to keep interoperability with Java.

### List vs Sequence

The operation on Lists are performed eagerly - they always happen immediately. When chaining List operation, the first result must be done before starting the next.

```kotlin
list.listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
  .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
  .any { it > 0 }
```

In this example, `filter()` operation from `1` to `n` must be completed before it can go to `any()` operation. Eager evaluation is intuitive and straightforward, but can be **_suboptimal_**. If you look carefully on the above example, it would make more sense to stop after encountering the first element that will satisfies the `any()`. This optimization might be much faster than evaluating every element and then search for a single match.

> Eager evaluation is called horizontal evaluation.

The alternative to _eager evaluation_ is _lazy evaluation_ : a result is computed only when needed.

> Performing lazy operations on sequence is called vertical evaluation.

With lazy evaluation, an operation is performed on an element only when that elementâ€™s associated result is requested. If the final result of a calculation is found before processing the last element, no further elements are processed.

This lazy evaluation optimization is simply done by converting `List` to `Sequence` using `asSequence()`.

```kotlin
list.listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
  .asSequence()
  .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
  .any { it > 0 }
```

### Two types of operation

There are two categories of `Sequence` operations: _intermediate_ and _terminal_. Intermediate operations return another `Sequence` as a result. `filter()` and `map()` are intermediate operations.

Terminal operations return a non-Sequence. To do this, a terminal operation executes all stored computations. For example, `any()` is the terminal operation that returns `Boolean`.

### Size of Sequence

`Collections` are a known size, discoverable through their `size` property. `Sequences` are treated as if they are **infinite**.

So what happen if we want to get some items - `takeIf` can be used, followed by a terminal operation like `toList()` or `sum()`.

```kotlin
items.takeIf { it % 2 == 0 }.toList()
```

## Summary

Sequences are a part of the language standard library and allow lazy evaluation of large amount of data (in millions), as opposed to collections, which compute and evaluate operations on a data set _eagerly_.
