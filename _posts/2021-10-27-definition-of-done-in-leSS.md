### Definition of Done

Are we done? Kind of. **Definition of Done (DoD)** is an agreed set of items that must be finished before we can consider the user story is done.

What if we are some undone work? For example, there are some items that need to be vested/tested by security team. We allocate some extra sprints before the release time to do undone work.

But it could be problematic if we uncovered something serious during the last sprint before the delivery.

> One way to expand the DoD more.

In LeSS agile, we only have a set of DoD. Each feature team will have the ability to expand DoD to suit the needs.
