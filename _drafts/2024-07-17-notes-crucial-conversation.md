## About this book

## Who should read

## My random notes and thoughts

There is no particular orders, but I took some notes along the way so that I could discuss it with my mentor.

### Use **ABC**s

When you want to disagree, use **ABC** response.

**A**- If you agree with some of what was said, respond by identifying what you agree with. Instead of saying "I disagree," he should have said, "Mike, I agree that we should do xyz."

**B**- If you agree and want to add to it, build on their idea. "I agree we should to do xyz. I also think we should do 123."

**C**- If you disagree with what was said, don't attack, criticize, or disagree. Rather, compare your opinion. This is often best done by first paraphrasing the other person's idea, then sharing your own. For example, "Mike, you think we should do xyz. Is that right? I think we should do 123."

### Paraphrase and Priming

Both paraphrase and prime can produce immediate and measurable impact on an **interaction**, Paraphrase is more well-known than prime.

Paraphrase is simply taking time to repeat back what you've heard. It could have a big impact on others. Instead of formulating a response, focus on what is being said. It is not only important that you use this skill, but how you use this skill.

> The message you want to send is not only that you are staying on track with conversation, but also that you are okay with what is being shared.

Priming is by paraphrasing with a little inference. Priming is where empathy and paraphrasing meet. To do well, you need to put yourself in the other's position, take what's been shared, and make an educated guess as to how they are thinking and feeling about the topic. For example, you ask: "It sounds like you've experienced things from me that make you think I have a grudge about how things went at the end. Is that right? What have I done that looked like that?"

### Learn to look at level

When it comes to the conversation, we could engage at two levels, `content` and `process`.

Pay attention to what other is saying (`content`). But also pay attention to signs that safety is at risk (`process`). If the other person moved to violence with the response to the proposal, it means the person is not feeling safe.

### Start with Heart

Before start a crucial conversation, pause and ask yourself what you really want. In this way when the other person becomes emotional, you got a longer-term perspective that helps keep you **on course**.

### Choose your topic

You've got multiple topics competing for your attention. Therefore, it is important to pick the most important topic that you want to address and focus on the topic.

### Make it safe

While you want to keep dialogue consists of the free flow of meaning, that would stop when one feels a lack of safety. If you noticed that you and the others have moved away from dialogue, do something to make it safer.

> If you simply understand that your challenge is to make it safer, 9 out of 10 times, you'll intuitively do something that helps.

The action could be as simple as by asking a question or showing interest in others' views. Apologies, smiles, even a request of a short "time-out" can help restore safety.

The main idea is to make it safe for everyone, so the dialogue could be effective.

### Learn to look at people reaction

When people feel unsafe, they will react with either "silence" or "violence". People who improve their dialogue skills continually ask themselves whether they're in or out of dialogue.

### Do not wait

Most people avoid sensitive issues like the plague. Unfortunately, when fear and misapplied compassion rule over honesty and courage, people can go for years without being given information that could be extremely helpful.

When people do speak up, they often leap from silence to violence. Jokes, nicknames, and other veiled attempts to sneak in vague feedback are both indirect and disrespectful. Also, the longer you go without saying anything, the greater the pain when you finally deliver the message.

### Use Contrasting to make it safe

Use Contrasting. Explain that you don't want to hurt the person's feelings, but you do want to share something that could be helpful. Establish Mutual Purpose. Let the other person know your intentions are honorable.

### Talk your expectations out

Stop acting out your expectations that others won't take initiative. Instead, talk your expectations out and come to agreements that place the responsibility on the team members while giving you information early enough that you aren't left high and dry.

### Help them coming up with solution

Jointly brainstorm what the person could have done to be both more persistent and more creative in coming up with a solution.

For instance: "I asked you to finish up a task that absolutely had to be completed before I returned from a trip. You ran into a problem, tried to get in touch with me, and then simply left a message with my four-year-old. What could you have done to track me down on the road?" or "What would it have taken to create a backup strategy?"

### Trust is offered in degrees

Trust doesn't have to be universally offered. In truth, it's usually offered in degrees and is very topic-specific. It also comes in two flavors — ***motive*** and ***ability***. For example, you can trust me to administer CPR if needed; I'm motivated. But you can't trust me to do a good job; I know nothing about it.

> Deal with trust around the issue, not around the person.

When it comes to regaining trust in others, don't set the bar too high. Just try to trust them in the moment, not across all issues. You don't have to trust them in everything. To Make It Safe for yourself in the moment, bring up your concerns. Tentatively STATE what you see happening: "I get the sense that you're only sharing the good side of your plan. I need to hear the possible risks before I'm comfortable. Is that OK?"

### Contrasting to invite other's view

Contrasting can also help: "I'm not trying to blow this out of proportion. I just want to deal with it before it gets out of hand." Share your facts: describe the specific behaviors you've observed: "When Jimmy leaves his room a mess, you use sarcasm to get his attention. You call him a 'pig' and then laugh as if you didn't mean it." Tentatively explain the consequences: "I don't think it's having the effect you want. He doesn't pick up on the hint, and I'm afraid that he's starting to resent you" (your story). Encourage testing: "Do you see it differently?"

### Some issues could be tricky

Some issues such as sexual harassment, personal hygiene, religion and racism are tricky.

If you can be respectful and private but firm in this conversation, most problem behavior will stop. And remember, if the behavior is over the line and the person appears intentionally sexually aggressive, you should contact HR rather than attempt a private and dangerous conversation. Furthermore, if after a conversation like this, the behavior continues, involve HR to ensure your rights and safety are protected.

### Remember to record conversation

One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds." Don't leave your hard work to memory. If you've gone to the effort to complete a Crucial Conversation, don't fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your memories. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and assignments. Remember to record who does what by when. Revisit your notes at key times (usually the next meeting) and review assignments.

Second, make sure you have identified an action. What is going to change because of this conversation? Again, it can be helpful to share the why behind this:

Finally, you need to make a plan to follow up. No one's perfect, and there is a reasonably good chance that someone, maybe you, won't follow up perfectly on the commitments you've made. That's OK. That's being human, after all. But you want to have a plan in place to follow up so that you can catch things early and correct them sooner.

### Communicate clearly on your expectation

Perhaps you'll prefer to rely on milestones: "Let me know when you've completed your library research. Then we'll sit down and look at the next steps." Milestones, of course, must be linked to a ***drop-dead date***: "Let me know as soon you've completed the research component of this project. You've got until the last week in November, but if you finish earlier, give me a call."

By When?

It's shocking how often people leave this element out of an assignment. Instead of giving a deadline, people simply point to the setting sun of "someday." With vague or unspoken deadlines, other urgencies come up, and the assignment finds its way to the bottom of the pile, where it is soon forgotten. Assignments without deadlines are far better at producing guilt than stimulating action. *Goals without deadlines aren't goals; they're merely directions*."

### Use Contrasting to show the expectation

To help clarify deliverables, use Contrasting. If you've seen people misunderstand an assignment in the past, *explain the common mistake as an example of what you don't want*. If possible, point to physical examples. Rather than talk in the abstract, bring a prototype or sample.

When you're first agreeing on an assignment, clarify up front the boundary conditions of what you want. For example, "I want a steam-powered car that is at least as safe, cost effective, and feature-rich as petroleum-powered cars." Couples get into trouble in this area when one of the parties doesn't want to take the time to think carefully.

Be sure to spell out the exact deliverables you have in mind. The fuzzier the expectations, the higher the likelihood of disappointment.

To quote an English proverb, "Everybody's business is nobody's business." If you don't make an actual assignment to an actual person, there's a good chance that nothing will ever come of all the work you've gone through to make a decision.

### Not every conversation needs a decision

Does every Crucial Conversation need to end with a decision? Not necessarily. If our goal in a conversation is to get unstuck and improve our results, then yes, most often we will need to end with a decision — what is going to be different because of this conversation? But sometimes we fill the pool with so much new meaning that we may not be ready to move to a decision at the end of the conversation. And that's OK.

### Difference between consult vs consensus

This is a pretty understandable and frankly common misconception, especially when you're dealing with consult versus consensus decisions. It's also easy to avoid. Once you've decided how you'll decide, make sure everyone knows.

It can be as simple as saying: "Your input is critical here. And please be aware, this is a consult decision. I'll take your input along with that of others and make the decision".

Some decision could be both consensus or consult, - "I'd like for this to be a consensus decision. But we need to make the decision today, and we only have an hour for this meeting. If we can come to consensus in that time frame, great. If not, I'll take all your input and make the final decision."

While you are thinking who to invite for consulting or find consensus - here are a few things to think about:

- Who knows? Identify who has the expertise you need to make the best decision.
- Who must agree? Think of those whose cooperation you might need in the form of authority or influence in any decisions you might make
- How many people is it worth involving? Your goal should be to involve the fewest number of people

### Voting

Sometime, they may discuss options for a while and then call for a vote. When facing several decent options, voting is a great time saver but should never be used when team members don't agree to support whatever decision is made. In these cases, consensus is required.

This consensus method can be both a great blessing and a frustrating curse. Consensus means you talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision. This method can produce tremendous unity and high-quality decisions. If misapplied, it can also be a horrible waste of time"

Voting is best suited to situations where efficiency is the highest value and you're selecting from a number of good options. Members of the team realize they may not get their first choice, but frankly they don't want to waste time talking the issue.

### Consulting

Consulting is a process whereby decision makers invite others to influence them before they make their choice. You can consult with experts, a representative from population, or even everyone who wants to offer an opinion. Consulting can be an efficient way of gaining ideas and support without bogging down the decision-making process.

When you're the boss, you make a host of command decisions out of ***pure efficiency***. And that is as it should be. A key to being an effective leader is knowing which decisions are worth slowing down to allow for some level of involvement in the form of consulting, voting, or consensus decision-making.

In the case of external forces, customers set prices, agencies mandate safety standards, and other governing bodies simply hand us demands. As much as employees like to think their bosses are sitting around making choices, *for the most part they're simply passing on the demands of the circumstances*. These are command decisions. With external command decisions, it's not our job to decide what to do. It's our job to decide how to make it work.

### Making decision when authority isn't clear

When there is no clear line of authority, deciding how to decide can be quite difficult. For instance, consider a conversation you had with your daughter's schoolteacher. The teacher suggested you should hold your child back. You're not sure. But whose choice is this anyway? Who decides whose choice it is? Does everyone have a say, then a vote? Is it the school officials' responsibility, so they choose? Since parents have ultimate responsibility, should they consult with the appropriate experts and then decide? Is there even a clear answer to this tough question?

To avoid violated expectations, **separate dialogue from decision-making**. Make it clear how decisions will be made — who will be involved and why.

### Making decision when authority is clear

When you're in a position of authority, you decide which method of decision-making you'll use. Managers and parents, for example, decide how to decide. It's part of their responsibility as leaders. For instance, VPs don't ask hourly employees to decide on pricing changes or product lines. That's the leaders' job. Parents don't ask small children to pick their home security device or to set their own bedtime. That's the job of the parent

### During Crucial Conversations

**Engage** - Examine what you were told. If you've done a good job reestablishing feelings of safety and worth, you'll look for truth rather than defensively poking holes in the feedback. Sift through the bag/pool of meaning. Even if it's 95 percent junk and 5 percent gold, look for the gold.
**Recover** - It's sometimes best at this point to ask for a time-out. Feelings of control bring feelings of safety. And you regain a sense of control when you exercise your right to respond when you're truly ready. Explain that you want some time to reflect and you'll respond when you have a chance to do so.
**Understand** - Be curious. Ask questions and ask for examples. And then just listen. As we learned in the previous chapter, curiosity can inoculate you against defensiveness. Focusing on understanding helps interrupt our tendency toward personalizing.
**Collect yourself**. Breathing deeply and slowly reminds you that you are safe. It signals that you don't need to be preparing for physical defense. Being mindful of your feelings helps, too. Do your best to name them as you feel them. Naming them helps you put a little bit of daylight between you and the emotions.

### Take back the pen

Here is an interesting real life story when it comes to reacting to feedback.

> "The The Other Side Academy (TOSA) Builders has an impeccable reputation for integrity and quality. And if you read online reviews of The Other Side Thrift Boutique, you'd think people were describing a stay at a Four Seasons resort. How does this happen? How can deeply broken people come to work harmoniously together to accomplish results that would be the envy of the finest companies on the planet?
>
> Online client review about TOSA (The Other Side Academy) service

The sensible response to feedback would be to do what TOSA students do: "Put it in a bag, sort out what's true, and discard the rest". But we don't. Instead, whether it's true, false, or a combination, we react to it indiscriminately with hurt, shame, fear, or anger. Why? Because we live with an undercurrent of worry that we aren't worthy. It is our fear that we're inadequate, unlovable, or worthless that makes the opinions of others so threatening. When others hold our pens, we live with a constant gnawing fear of their disapproval. Their feedback is no longer an indictment of our behavior; it is an audit of our worth.

Feedback only hurts when we believe it threatens one or both of our most fundamental psychological needs: ***safety*** (perceived physical, social, or material security) and ***worth*** (a sense of self-respect, self-regard, or self-confidence).

Notice that when you sort it this way, you make a tacit assumption. The sorting is based on the magnitude of the message. We assume that minor criticisms of easily changed behaviors would hurt much less than major judgments about deep character flaws. We have no doubt that being called "evil scum" would be deeply scarring, while being told "You start conversations in the middle" would feel like a paper cut. It is this belief that distracts us from the work it takes to sever others' judgments from our worth. "You start conversations in the middle. You don't ask people if they have time; you just engage when it's convenient for you."

Often newer students don't take their games very well. They withdraw, deny, or lash out against those who are telling them things they don't want to hear. But that changes quickly. They soon learn to let others say whatever they want to say, however they want to say it. They discover that they are the only sure source of their own sense of safety and worth. That discovery is liberating. They stop blaming the world for how they feel and become responsible for their own serenity.

Metaphorically speaking, they learn to retake their pen. In TOSA, they have Games weekly. In Games, people sit in groups of 20 and give each other unvarnished feedback. The fundamental belief is that relentless exposure to truth is the best path to empathy, growth, and happiness.

Games can be loud. Vocabulary is sometimes raw. A single student can be the focus of a score of colleagues for 15 to 20 minutes without letup. Peers present you with evidence that you have acted dishonestly, manipulatively, lazily, selfishly, or arrogantly. There is little emphasis placed on diplomatic delivery of the message. Instead, peers focus on helping individuals learn to "take their game." Taking your game means, in essence, learning to listen non-defensively. Older students advise you to "just listen. Then put it all in a bag and take it to your pillow tonight. There you can decide what is gold and what is crap."

### Disagreement is okay

When you have someone who like to share their feedback, but not willing to listen other people; how to do you deal with it? How do you disagree with someone who is not willing to listen to you? How about this reply to an uncle who has strong opinion about some politic view?

"Uncle Carl, I can tell that you're really passionate about this, and I would sincerely like to explore and understand your point of view. I'm pretty sure it's different from mine, and it would be great to learn more about what you think. I'm committing to listening with an open mind. I wonder if, once I've done that, you'd be willing to listen to my point of view with an open mind. How about it?"

If Carl says no, then you can walk away from the conversation and feel OK about it. Nothing requires you to listen to his monologues. But chances are he'll agree to this reasonable request. Once he does, and it's your turn to share your perspective, don't be surprised if he needs a gentle reminder (or five of them!) of the commitment he made to listen."

"Finally, if you do disagree, compare your path with the other person's. That is, rather than suggesting that the other person is wrong, suggest that you differ. He or she may, in fact, be wrong, but you don't know for sure until you hear both sides of the story. For now, you just know that the two of you differ. So instead of pronouncing "Wrong!," start with a tentative but candid opening. For example:

"I see things differently. Let me describe how."

"I come at this from a different perspective."

"My data stream is different from yours. Can I share it?"

We do this because we're trained to look for minor errors from an early age. For instance, we learn in kindergarten that if you have the right answer, you're the teacher's pet. Being right is good. Of course, if others have the right answer, they get to be the pet. So being right first is even better. You learn to look for even the tiniest of errors in others' facts, thinking, or logic. Then you point out the errors.

> Being right at the expense of others is best.

By the time you finish your education, you have a virtual PhD in catching trivial differences and turning them into a major deal. So when another person offers up a suggestion (based on facts and stories), you're looking to disagree. And when you do find a minor difference, you turn this snack into a meal. Instead of remaining in healthy dialogue, you end up in **violent agreement**.

On the other hand, when you watch people who are skilled in dialogue, it becomes clear that they're not playing this everyday game of Trivial Pursuit—looking for trivial differences and then proclaiming them aloud. In fact, they're looking for points of agreement. *As a result, they'll often start with the words "I agree." Then they talk about the part they agree with. At least, that's where they start.*

Now when the other person has merely left out an element of the argument, skilled people will agree and then build. Rather than saying: "Wrong. You forgot to mention . . . ," they say: "Absolutely. In addition, I noticed that . . ."

If you agree with what has been said but the information is incomplete, build. Point out areas of agreement, and then add elements that were left out of the discussion.
So here's the takeaway. If you completely agree with the other person's path, say so and move on. Agree when you agree. Don't turn an agreement into an argument.

Of course, the reason most of us turn agreements into debates is because we disagree with a certain portion of what the other person has said. Never mind that it's a minor portion. If it's a point of disagreement, we'll jump all over it like the last piece of chocolate pie at the dessert buffet.

### Priming

Now this is not the kind of thing you would do unless nothing else has worked. You really want to hear from others, and you have a very strong idea of what they're probably thinking. Priming is an act of good faith, taking risks, becoming vulnerable, and building safety in hopes that others will share their meaning.
He or she is going to silence or violence, and we want to know why. We want to get back to the source (the facts and story), where we can solve the problem. To encourage the person to share, we've tried three listening tools. We've **asked**, **mirrored**, and **paraphrased**. The person is still upset, but isn't explaining his or her stories or facts.

Now what? At this point, we may want to back off. After a while, our attempts to make it safe for others can start feeling as if we're pestering or prying. If we push too hard, we violate both purpose and respect. Others may think our purpose is merely to extract what we want from them, and conclude that we don't care about them personally. So instead, we back off.

When you get a clue about why the person is feeling as he or she does, you can build additional safety by paraphrasing what you've heard. Be careful not to simply parrot back what was said. Instead, put the message in your own words—usually in an abbreviated form: "Let's see if I've got this right. You're worried because the previous project manager was fired. You're wondering if you or others on the project team might be at risk as well."

The key to paraphrasing, as with mirroring, is to remain calm and collected. Our goal is to make it safe, not to act horrified and suggest that the conversation is about to turn ugly. Stay focused on figuring out how a reasonable, rational, and decent person could have created this Path to Action. This task can help keep you from becoming angry or defensive. Simply rephrase what the person said, and do it in a way that suggests that it's OK, you're trying to understand, and it's safe for him or her to talk candidly.
"If asking others to share their path doesn't open things up, mirroring can help build more safety. In mirroring, we take the portion of the other person's Path to Action we have access to and make it safe for him or her to discuss it. All we have so far are actions and some hints about the other person's emotions, so we start there.

We play the role of mirror by describing how the other person looks or acts. Although we may not understand others' stories or facts, we can see their actions and reflect them.
"Mirroring is most useful when another person's tone of voice or gestures (hints about the emotions behind them) are inconsistent with his or her words. For example: "Don't worry. I'm fine." (But the person's look and tone suggest he's actually quite upset. He's frowning, looking around, and sort of kicking at the ground.)

Our response: "Really? From the way you're saying that, it doesn't sound like you are."

We explain that while the person may be saying one thing, his tone of voice or posture suggests something else.

### Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, or Prime (AMPP)

To encourage others to share their paths, we'll use four power listening tools. We call the four skills power listening tools because they are best remembered with the acronym **AMPP** — ask, mirror, paraphrase, and prime. These tools work regardless of whether people are in silence or violence.

### Ask to Get Things Rolling

The easiest and most straightforward way to encourage others to share their Path to Action is simply to invite them to express themselves. For example, often all it takes to break an impasse is to seek to understand others' views. When we show genuine interest, people feel less compelled to use silence or violence. Being willing to stop filling the pool with your meaning and invite the other person to talk about his or her view can go a long way toward getting to the source of the problem.

If you want to stand a chance at influencing people, you have to start by understanding them. So tone down your approach. Open yourself up to the belief that others might have something to say, and better still, they might even hold a piece of the puzzle and then ask them for their views. Back off your harsh and conclusive language. But don't back off your belief. Hold to your belief; merely soften your approach.

When you find yourself wanting to simply announce the truth rather than engage in dialogue, use the skills you've learned up to this point:

- First, Learn to Look. Watch for the moment when people start to resist you — perhaps they begin to raise their volume and/or overstate the facts behind their views in reaction to your tactics — or perhaps they retreat into silence. Turn your attention away from the topic (no matter how important) and onto yourself.
- Second, check your intent. What is your goal in the conversation? Do you want to be heard, understood, or validated? Maybe you want to change the other person's mind. You can't control or determine what another person will think.

Unfortunately, as stakes rise and others argue differing views — and you just know in your heart that you're right and they're wrong, you start pushing too hard. You simply have to win. There's too much at risk, and only you have the right ideas. Left to their own devices, others will mess things up. So when you care a great deal and are sure of your views, you don't merely speak — you try to force your opinions into the pool of meaning. You know, drown people in your truth. Quite naturally, others resist. You in turn push even harder.

We've watched this kind of thing happen all the time in our consulting work. For instance, seated around the table are a group of leaders who are starting to debate an important topic. First, someone hints that she's the only one with any real insight. Then someone else starts tossing out facts like so many poisonous darts. Another — it just so happens someone with critical information — retreats into silence. As emotions rise, words that were once carefully chosen and tentatively delivered are now spouted with an absolute certainty that is typically reserved for claims that are nailed to church doors or carved on stone tablets.

In the end, nobody is listening, everyone is committed to silence or violence, and the Pool of Shared Meaning remains parched and tainted. Nobody wins.

### Play devil's advocate

Occasionally you can tell that others are not buying into your facts or story, but they're not speaking up either. You've sincerely invited them, even encouraged differing views, but nobody says anything. To help grease the skids, play devil's advocate. Model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view: "Maybe I'm wrong here. What if the opposite is true? What if the reason sales have dropped is because our products truly are outdated. I know I've made the opposite case, but I really want to hear all the reasons my position could be dangerously wrong.

Encourage others until your motive becomes obvious. At times — particularly if you're in a position of authority — even being appropriately tentative doesn't prevent others from suspecting that you want them to simply agree with you or that you're inviting them into a trap. This may be the case when former bosses or authority figures have invited people to speak and then punished them for doing so.

This is where the skill of encouraging testing comes into play. As we said earlier, you can argue as vigorously as you want for your point of view, provided you are even more vigorous about encouraging others to disprove it. The real test of whether your motive is to win a debate or engage in real dialogue is the degree to which you encourage testing.

### Invitation, not threat

Sometimes people offer an invitation that sounds more like a threat than a legitimate call for opinions: "Well, that's how I see it. Nobody disagrees, do they?" Don't turn an invitation into a veiled threat. Invite people with both words and tone that say, "I really want to hear from you." For instance: "I know people have been reluctant to speak up about this, but I would really love to hear from everyone." Or "I know there are at least two sides to this story. Could we hear differing views now? What problems could this decision cause us?

Invite opposing views. If you think others may be hesitant, make it clear that you want to hear their views — no matter how different. If their views disagree with yours, so much the better. If what they have to say is controversial or even touchy, respect them for finding the courage to express what they're thinking. If they have different facts or stories, you need to hear them to help complete the picture. Make sure they have the opportunity to share by actively inviting them to do so: "Does anyone see it differently?" "What am I missing here?" "I'd really like to hear the other side of this story."

### Be firm with your message

Some people are so worried about being too forceful or pushy that they err in the other direction. They wimp out by making still another Fool's Choice. They figure that the only safe way to share touchy data is to act as if it's not important: "I know this is probably not true . . ." or "Call me crazy, but . . ."

When you begin with a complete disclaimer and a tone that suggests you're consumed with doubt, **you do the message a disservice**. It's one thing to be humble and open. It's quite another to be clinically uncertain. Use language that says you're sharing an opinion, not language that says you're a nervous wreck.

Talking tentatively simply means that we tell our story as a story rather than disguising it as a hard fact. "Perhaps you were unaware . . ." suggests that you're not absolutely certain of what the person knew. "In my opinion . . ." says you're sharing an opinion and no more.

### Sharing negative conclusion

It takes confidence. It can be difficult to share negative conclusions and unattractive judgments (e.g., "I'm wondering if you're a thief"). It takes confidence to share such a potentially inflammatory story. However, if you've done your homework by thinking through the facts behind your story, you'll realize that you are drawing a reasonable, rational, and decent conclusion. One that deserves to be heard. And by starting with the facts, you've laid the groundwork. When you think through the facts and then lead with them, you're much more likely to have the confidence you need to add controversial and vitally important meaning to the shared pool.

Sharing your story can be tricky. You need to earn the right to share your story by starting with your facts. Even then, the other person can still become defensive when you move from facts to stories. After all, you're sharing potentially unflattering conclusions and judgments.

Why share your story in the first place? Because the facts alone are rarely worth mentioning. It's the facts plus the conclusion that call for a face-to-face.
Take the time to sort out facts from conclusions. Gathering the facts is the homework required for Crucial Conversations.

Facts are the least controversial. Facts provide a safe beginning. By their very nature, facts are less controversial. For example, consider the statement, "Yesterday you arrived at work at 8:20 a.m." Little dispute there. Conclusions, on the other hand, are highly controversial. For example, "You were 20 minutes late" begins to include some story. It adds an assumption that you were expected to arrive at 8 a.m. Another option, "You can't be trusted," is hardly a fact. It's more like an insult, and it can certainly be disputed. Leaping from the 8:20 arrival to an assumption of tardiness to a story of unreliability moves us quickly from firm to questionable ground. Eventually we may want to share our conclusions, but we certainly don't want to open up with a controversy. Start with areas of least disagreement before moving to those with most.

### Humility

When it comes to sharing touchy information, the worst alternate between bluntly dumping their ideas into the pool of meaning is saying nothing at all. Either they start with, "You're not going to like this, but, hey, somebody has to be honest . . ." (a classic Fool's Choice), or they simply stay quiet.

Those who are good at dialogue say some of what's on their minds, but they understate their views out of fear of hurting others. They talk all right, but they carefully sugarcoat their message. For example, rather than being honest that they think your marketing piece will be an embarrassment to the company, they say: "Uh, well, I like the graphics a lot. But I think we can spice up the text a little here and there."

The best at dialogue speak their minds completely and do it in a way that makes it safe for others to hear what they have to say and respond to it as well. **They are both totally candid and completely respectful**. If they think the marketing piece is bad, they make sure when they are done that you know they think the marketing piece is bad. But they do so in a way that is 100 percent respectful as well.

> How? By finding a way to maintain safety without compromising candor.
Our hearts need to be in the right place, and our heads need to be focused on the right topic. We need to let go of the clever stories that are keeping us stuck. We need to learn to look closely at how people are engaging in the dialogue — particularly when people start feeling unsafe — so that we can restore safety when necessary.

We tend to think of asynchronous, written communication as a distant second-best when it comes to having Crucial Conversations. And in most ways, it is. However, there is one advantage to asynchronous communication if you are savvy enough to use it. With virtual communication, like email, you get your second chance before you need it, before you even messed up. Rather than saying something and then thinking, "I could have said that better," you get to write something and then reread it before you ever send it. We have to learn the discipline of taking that second chance to build safety before we need it.

### Mutual Purpose

Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Ask people why they want what they're pushing for. Separate what they're demanding from the purpose it serves.
"Commit to seek a Mutual Purpose. Make a unilateral public commitment to stay in the conversation until you come up with something that serves everyone.

For example, I come home from work and say that I want to go to a movie. You say that you want to stay home and relax. And so we debate: movie, TV, movie, read, etc. We figure we'll never be able to resolve our differences because going out and staying home are incompatible.

In such circumstances, we can break the impasse by asking others, "Why do you want that?" In the above case, it might go like this:

"Why do you want to stay home?"

"Because I'm tired of running around and dealing with the hassle of the city."

"So you want peace and quiet?"

"Mostly. And why do you want to go to a movie?"

"Because I want to spend some times with you in a quiet place"

"In this case, why don't we go the peaceful and quiet park?"

So next time you find yourself stuck in a battle of wills, try this amazingly powerful but simple skill: Step out of the content of the struggle and make it safe. Simply say: "It seems like we're both trying to force our view on each other. I commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that satisfies both of us." Then watch whether safety takes a turn for the better.

As with most dialogue skills, if we want to get back to dialogue, we have to Start with Heart. In this case, we have to agree to agree. To be successful, we have to stop using silence or violence to compel others to our view. We must even surrender false dialogue, where we pretend to have Mutual Purpose (calmly arguing our side until the other person gives in). We Start with Heart by committing to stay in the conversation until we invent a solution that serves a purpose we both share.

This can be tough. To stop arguing, we have to suspend our belief that our choice is the absolute best and only one, and that we'll never be happy until we get exactly what we currently want. We have to open our mind to the fact that maybe, just maybe, there is a third choice out there—one that suits everyone.

The worst at dialogue either ignore the problem and push ahead or roll over and let others have their way. They opt for either competition or submission. Both strategies end up making winners and losers, and the problem continues long beyond the initial conversation.

The good at dialogue move immediately toward compromise. For example, the couple facing the transfer sets up two households — one where the transferred spouse will be working and one where the family currently lives. Nobody really wants this arrangement, and frankly, it's a pretty ugly solution that's bound to lead to more serious problems, even divorce. While compromise is sometimes necessary, the best know better than to start there.

The best at dialogue use four skills to create a Mutual Purpose. If it helps you remember what to do, note that the four skills used in creating Mutual Purpose form the acronym CRIB. CRIB stands for **commit** to seek mutual purpose, **recognize** the purpose behind the strategy, **invent** a mutual purpose, and **brainstorm** new strategies.

### Contrasting

> Contrasting is a don't/do statement that fixes misunderstandings

Use Contrasting to provide context and proportion. When you're in the middle of a touchy conversation, sometimes others experience your words as bigger or worse than you intend. For example, you talk with your assistant about his lack of punctuality. When you share your concern, he appears crushed.

At this point, you could be tempted to water down your content — "You know it's really not that big a deal." Don't give in to the temptation. Don't take back what you've said, and don't apologize for it. Instead, put your remarks in context. For instance, at this point your assistant may believe you are completely dissatisfied with his performance. He believes that your view of the issue at hand represents the totality of your respect for him. If this belief is incorrect, use Contrasting to clarify what you don't and do believe. Start with what you don't believe.

Of the two parts of Contrasting, the **don't** is the more important because it deals with the misunderstanding that has put safety at risk. The employees who worked so hard are acting on the belief that you don't appreciate their efforts and didn't care enough to keep them informed — when the exact opposite was true. When people misunderstand and you start arguing over the misunderstanding, stop. Use Contrasting. Explain what you don't mean until you've restored safety. Then return to the conversation. Safety first.
In the "do" part of the statement, you clarify what your intention for the conversation really is. This confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose.

The same can happen with Mutual Purpose. You can start by innocently sharing your views, but other people believe your intention is to harm them or coerce them into accepting your opinion. Clearly an apology is not appropriate in these circumstances. It would be disingenuous to admit you were wrong when you weren't. How, then, can you rebuild Mutual Purpose or Mutual Respect in order to make it safe to get back to dialogue?

### Mutual Respect

"I'm sorry I didn't give you a call when I learned that we wouldn't be coming by. You worked all night. It would have been a wonderful chance to showcase your improvements, and I didn't even explain to you what happened. I apologize."

Now an apology isn't really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you really want. You have to sacrifice a bit of your ego by admitting your error. But like many sacrifices, when you give up something you value, you're rewarded with something even more valuable — healthy dialogue and better results.

We've also argued that you should be able to find a way to both find Mutual Purpose and enjoy Mutual Respect—even with people who are flawed or different.

But how? What are you supposed to actually do? Here are four skills that the best at dialogue routinely use to build safety up front in a conversation and rebuild safety when it's been lost:

• Share your good intent.
• Apologize when appropriate.
• Contrast to fix misunderstandings.
• Create a Mutual Purpose.

A rather clever person once hinted how to do this in the form of a prayer — "Lord, help me forgive those who sin differently than I." When we recognize that we all have weaknesses, it's easier to find a way to respect others. When we do this, we feel a kinship between ourselves and even the thorniest of people. This connection to others helps create Mutual Respect and eventually enables us to stay in dialogue with virtually anyone.

For example, you're talking with a group of supervisors about a complicated quality problem. You really want to see the problem resolved once and for all. Your job depends on it. Unfortunately, you also think the supervisors are overpaid and under-qualified. You firmly believe that not only are they in over their heads, but they do stupid things all the time. Some of them even act unethically.

As the supervisors throw out ideas, you roll your eyes. The disrespect you carry in your head creeps out in one unfortunate gesture, and now it's all over. Without Mutual Respect, the conversation tanks. The supervisors take shots at your proposals. You add insulting adjectives in describing theirs. As attention turns to scoring points, everyone loses. Your Mutual Purpose suffers from a lack of Mutual Respect.

Imagine raising the topic this way: "I've got some ideas for how I can be much more reliable and even reduce costs by a few thousand dollars in preparing the report each month. It's going to be a bit of a sensitive conversation — but I think it will help a great deal if we can talk about it." Now you've got a Mutual Purpose.

While it's true that there's no reason to enter a Crucial Conversation if you don't have Mutual Purpose, it's equally true that you can't stay in the conversation if you don't maintain Mutual Respect. Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As people perceive that others don't respect them, the conversation immediately becomes unsafe, and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.

Human beings have an innate need to be heard. We want to be listened to and understood. So a great Mutual Purpose to start with is to seek mutual understanding. If the other person truly believes you sincerely want to understand his or her needs or point of view, you have the basic makings of safety. And once the other person feels deeply understood, he or she is more likely to have the psychological resources to listen to you.

This is the first condition of safety — Mutual Purpose. Mutual Purpose means that others perceive that you're working toward a common outcome in the conversation, that you care about their goals, interests, and values. And vice versa. You believe they care about yours. Consequently, Mutual Purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. Find a shared goal, and you have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking.

In order for people to feel safe with you, they need to know two things about your intent. They need to know that:

• You care about their concerns (Mutual Purpose).
• You care about them (Mutual Respect).

We call Mutual Purpose and Mutual Respect the conditions of dialogue. Only when these two conditions are met, when there is Mutual Purpose and Mutual Respect, will you have the safety needed for meaning to flow into the pool.

### No sugarcoating

Those who are good at dialogue realize that safety is at risk, but they fix it in exactly the wrong way. They try to make the subject more palatable by sugarcoating their message: "Oh, honey, I know you wanted to spend time together, but I was just so tired on Friday." They try to make things safer by watering down or dressing up their content. This strategy, of course, avoids the real problem, and it never gets fixed.

The best at dialogue don't play games. Period. They know that in order to solve their problem, they'll need to talk about their problem — with no pretending, sugarcoating, or faking. So they do something completely different. They step out of the content of the conversation, make it safe, and then step back in. Once safety is restored, they can talk about nearly anything.

they may carry unconscious biases toward you that make them feel less safe. This is one more reason to take on the task of generating clear and unmistakable evidence for them to the contrary.

It's not enough for you to have good intentions; the other person must know that this is the case. Think about this in the context of unconscious bias — the discomforts and judgments that we have about those who are different from us and that we are unaware we carry.

The key is to step out of the content of the conversation. That's right. When safety is at risk and you notice people moving to silence or violence, you need to step out of the content of the conversation (literally stop talking about the topic of your conversation) and rebuild safety. How do you do that?

You first need to understand why someone feels unsafe. People never become defensive about what you're saying (the content of your message). They become defensive because of why they think you're saying it (the intent).

> Safety in a conversation is about intent, not content.

If you spot safety risks as they happen, you can step out of the conversation, build safety, and then find a way to talk just about anything with just about anyone.

### Silence and Violence

As people begin to feel unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths. They move either to silence (withholding meaning from the pool) or to verbal violence (trying to force meaning in the pool).

Silence consists of any act to purposely withhold information from the pool of meaning. It's almost always done as a means of avoiding potential problems, and it always restricts the flow of meaning. Methods range from playing verbal games to avoiding a person entirely. The three most common forms of silence are *masking*, *avoiding*, and *withdrawing*.

Masking consists of understating or selectively showing our true opinions. Sarcasm, sugarcoating, and couching are some of the more popular forms:

"I think your idea is, uh, brilliant. Yeah, that's it. I just worry that others won't catch the subtle nuances. Some ideas come before their time, so expect some, uh, minor resistance."
*Meaning: Your idea is insane, and people will fight it with their last breath.*

But let's be honest. Have you ever lost your temper? Yelled at someone in the heat of the moment? Interrupted someone when you just couldn't take it anymore? Used your power (as a parent, boss, or expert) inappropriately to get what you want? You know . . . acted like a jerk? Probably. We all have at times. And guess what? We aren't jerks. We're just people who, in a tough moment, responded to a lack of safety with aggression. We see it in ourselves. We need to give people the respect and grace to see it in them. Obviously this can be difficult. But it's worth it.

Can you remember receiving really tough feedback from someone at some point in your life and not becoming defensive? Instead, you absorbed the feedback. You reflected on it. You allowed it to influence you. If so, ask yourself why. Why in this instance were you able to take potentially threatening feedback so well? If you're like the rest of us, it's because you believed the other person had your best interest in mind. In addition, you respected the other person's opinion. You felt safe receiving the feedback because you trusted the motives and ability of the other person. You didn't need to defend yourself from what was being said — even if you didn't like what the person was saying!

This is a pretty remarkable claim. Think about it. We're suggesting that people rarely become defensive simply because of what you're saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe, or when they question why you're saying the things you are. Specifically, they begin to speculate about either your respect ("Is this message a sign of disrespect?"), your intent ("Does this message tell me you have malicious motives toward me?"), or both. Either way, the problem is not the content of your message, but the condition of the conversation.

When it's safe, you can say anything. Here's why gifted communicators keep a close eye on safety. Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning—period. And nothing kills the flow of meaning like fear. When you fear people aren't buying into your ideas, you start pushing too hard. When you fear you may be harmed in some way, you start withdrawing and hiding. Both these reactions — fight and flight — are motivated by the same emotion.

> The sooner you notice you're not in dialogue, the easier it is to get back and the lower the costs. The sad corollary is that the longer it takes to notice you're not in dialogue, the harder it is to get back and the higher the costs.

Yet most of us have trouble noticing the early warning signs of declining communication. During Crucial Conversations, the key to maintaining dialogue is to learn to dual-process. Not only do you have to be attentive to the content of the conversation (what is being said), but you also have to skillfully observe the process (how it's being said). When stakes get high, we get so caught up in what we're saying that it can be nearly impossible to pull ourselves out of the argument.

### Victim Stories that we told ourselves

In Victim Stories we exaggerate our own innocence. In Villain Stories we overemphasize the other person's guilt or stupidity. We automatically assume the worst possible motives or grossest incompetence while ignoring any possible good or neutral intentions or skills a person may have. Often we'll dehumanize our villain further by replacing his or her name with a label. For example, "I can't believe that bonehead gave me bad materials again."

You tell your story in a way that judiciously avoids whatever you have done (or neglected to do) that might have contributed to the problem. For instance, last week your boss took you off a big project, and it hurt your feelings. You complained to everyone about how bad you felt. What you did not explain was that you failed to let your boss know that you were behind on an important project, leaving him high and dry — which is why he removed you in the first place. This part of the story you leave out because, hey, he made you feel bad.

To help support your Victim Stories, you speak of nothing but your noble motives: "I took longer because I was trying to beat the standard specs." Then you tell yourself that you're being punished for your virtues, not your vices: "He just doesn't appreciate a person with my superb attention to detail." (This added twist turns you from victim into martyr. What a bonus!)

Recognizing on some level your own bad behavior, you quickly come up with a perfectly plausible reason why what you did was OK: "Of course I yelled at him. Did you see what he did? He deserved it." Or "Hey, don't you dare judge me for not speaking up. I don't have a choice. I have to keep this job."

We call these imaginative and self-serving concoctions "clever stories." They're clever because they allow us to feel good about behaving badly. Better yet, they allow us to feel good about behaving badly even while achieving abysmal results.

> The best way to liberate yourself from an overpowering story is to separate facts from story. When trying to strip out story, it helps to test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you see or hear this thing you're calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?

For example, it is a fact that your teammate gave 95 percent of the presentation and answered all but one question. This is specific, objective, and verifiable.

Actually, identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they're feeling, they use words such as "bad" or "angry" or "scared" — which would be OK if these were accurate descriptors, but often they're not. Individuals say they're angry when, in fact, they're feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they're unhappy when they're feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they're upset when they're really feeling humiliated and hurt.

Since life doesn't consist of a series of vocabulary tests, you might wonder what difference words can make. But words do matter. Knowing what you're really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. For instance, you're far more likely to take an honest look at the story you're telling yourself if you admit you're feeling both embarrassed and surprised rather than simply angry.

The good news is we can tell different stories and break the loop. In fact, until we tell different stories, we cannot break the loop.

If you want improved results from your Crucial Conversations, change the stories you tell yourself — even while you're in the middle of the fray.
As it turns out, there is an intermediate step between what others do and how we feel. Just after we observe what others do and just before we feel some emotion about it, we tell ourselves a story. We add **meaning** to the action we observed. We make a guess at the *motive* driving the behavior. Why were they doing that? We also add **judgment** — is that good or bad? And then, based on these thoughts or stories, our body responds with an emotion.

### Play the long game

"It was easy," she explained. "At first I did feel attacked, and I wanted to strike back. To be honest, I wanted to put that guy in his place. He was accusing me in public, and he was wrong."

"But," she continued, "I've learned that when my emotions take over, the best way to get back into control is to focus on a simple question."

Human is an emotional animal. There will be many times in our life where we need to respond within a short time. A CEO shared her experience when she was newly picked as a CEO in an organization and she is having a meeting with managers about cost cutting measures. She noticed that many managers are not engaged or shown any progress in cost cutting measures that she has been trying to achieve. Suddenly in the meeting, a manager said something like she is spending so much on new offices while at the same time, trying to tell the rest of company to cut cost. Room was quiet for a moment. Later she managed to handle it well in the meeting and later, we asked her how she did it.

She said, "When that manager said that in front of all the managers, I feel ashamed and threatened."

She continued, "When I feel threatened, I pause, take a breath, and ask, 'What do I really want?'"

"Really?" we asked. "And how did that help?"

"The first answer that came up for me was, 'I want to humiliate this guy who is attacking me!' That was my emotions talking. So I pressed again, 'What do I really want?' And that's when the clarity came: 'What I really want is for 200 managers to leave here supportive of cost cutting.'"

She went on: "When that commitment settled inside me, it transformed the way I saw the man in the back of the room. Whereas seconds earlier he looked like an enemy, when my motive changed I could see he was the best ally I had in the room. He was the one handing me the best chance I had of dealing with the resistance I was facing. It was easy then to respond in the right way.""

> Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused on those motives no matter what happens.

They maintain this focus in two ways. First, they're steely-eyed smart when it comes to knowing what they want. Despite constant impulses to slip away from their goals, they stick with them. Second, skilled people don't make Fool's Choices. Unlike others who justify their unhealthy behavior by explaining that they had no choice but to fight or take flight, smart believe that dialogue, no matter the circumstances, is always an option.

They believe the best way to work on "us" is to start with "me."

### Relationship conversation

How do you respond to someone who is higher position than you do? Sandra is a project manager with many years of experience in the company. Sandrine is a new VP who joined recently as Sandra' manager. One day, Sandrine told Sandra that she needs to work on an important project. Sandra has prepared the timelines to discuss, and to her surprise, her manger has already committed to a timeline without Sandra's input. Sandrine said, "I understand you are one of the best project managers here. This is why I fight hard to give you this opportunity. This project is extremely important to the company."

How should Sandra respond?

She responded to Sandrine, saying, "I get we're in a tough spot here. I don't want to disappoint our leadership any more than you do. And I want you to know that I'm committed to getting stuff done. At the same time, I want us to set realistic goals; otherwise, we're setting ourselves up to fail. And maybe even more important, I want us to work together in a way where we're up front with each other about our needs and concerns."

This was the start of a relationship conversation. And the start of a better relationship.

### How do you stay in a dialogue

During the dialogue, when emotions are running high, how do you stay focused on the motive?

> You could place a bookmark.

When you place a bookmark, you make a conscious choice about what you want to talk about. And you register clearly with the other person that you will return to the bookmarked issue later. Never allow the conversation to shift or the topic to change without acknowledging you've done it.

In some cases, although probably not this one given the seriousness of the emergent issue, you may want to bookmark the new issue and stay focused on the original.

For example, when Tyra, the accountant is trying to get some urgent data from another person who is having another issue and steering the conversation into different issue, she might want to say, "Wow! That's a big deal, and I really want to talk to you about what you are experiencing because it needs to be addressed. At the same time, I have 30 minutes to get this data file over to the ops team. Let's figure out this data file issue and then come back to this."

Here is another example of a conversation with a graphic designer who recently have some performance issues. There is no ill intention here on the part of the graphic designer. He isn't purposely trying to steer you off course. He's just fallen into the trap we all fall into . . . choosing recent over right, or easy over hard. It's up to you to keep the conversation at the level you want it by saying, "I know there was a lot going on this week along with the Johnson project. I get that. And I'm actually less concerned with the specifics of the Johnson project than I am with the pattern I'm seeing in your work over the last six months. I'm wondering if there's something bigger going on here that's keeping you from delivering your best work."

Generally, you should choose the level at which you want to hold the conversation and then keep it there. However, the **pattern**, **process**, and **relationship** - level issues in our lives are like those roots. Until we identify and address them, we will face the same content issues again and again.

But beware. More often than not, when you step up to a pattern- or relationship-level conversation with someone, the other person's tendency will be to seek safety in a content-level conversation.

To have an effective dialogue,

1. Narrow the problem down to a succinct statement. This is harder than it sounds. Try stopping people who are great during Crucial Conversations right before they address a concern (we've done this). Ask them, "What's the issue you want to address?" You'll find that they take far fewer words to say it than the rest of us. The more words it takes you to describe the topic, the less prepared you are to talk. For example, when we asked one skilled person what his message was in a forthcoming performance review, he said, "I've concluded he is not good at managing people or projects." Boom! Crystal clear. Simple.
2. Having made your choice, be sure you can state simply what you want to discuss.
3. The next step in finding the right topic to discuss is to choose. Choosing is a matter of filtering all the issues you've teased apart through a single question: "What do I really want?"

### CPR (Content, Pattern and Relationship)

CPR is a powerful entry point as we begin to unravel complex interactions and consider the issues that are keeping us stuck. But not every issue fits neatly into content, pattern, and relationship. Occasionally you'll need to extend your conversation to cover the issue of the process of how we are discussing issues.

**Relationship** Finally, as problems continue, they can begin to impact the relationship. Relationship issues get to deeper concerns about trust, competence, or respect. 

**Pattern** The next time the same problem comes up, think pattern. Now the concern is not just that this has happened once, but that a pattern is starting to develop, or already has. For example, the last three times a really exciting project came to your team, your manager assigned it to others despite your expressed interest. The issue is no longer just one assignment; it's the pattern that's emerging.

**Content** The first time a problem comes up, talk about the content — the immediate pain. If either the action itself or its immediate consequences are the issue, you've got a content problem. For example, your coworker failed to get you the marketing analytics you needed in order to finish a report for your manager. Now your neck is on the line because your report was late.

How do you know that you are on right topic? You're in a dèjá vu dialogue. If you ever have the same conversation with the same people a second time, the problem is not them. It's you. You're having the wrong conversation. Your emotions escalate. When you're having the wrong conversation, even if that conversation is going well, you know on some level that you're not addressing or resolving the issue.

## Conclusion

The mistake most of us make in our Crucial Conversations is we believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a friend. We begin believing in the Fool's Choice from an early age.

When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions start to run strong, casual conversations transform into crucial ones. Ironically, the more crucial the conversation, the less likely we are to handle it well. When we fail a Crucial Conversation, every aspect of our lives can be affected — from our companies, to our careers, to our communities, to our relationships, to our personal health. And the longer the lag time, the more room for mischief.
