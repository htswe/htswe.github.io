### Lesson on 1:1

Have you tried doing retro on 1:1? It is an advanced level. How do you do it?
1. Let each team member know that next 1:1 will be used to discuss about our 1:1 meetings.
2. Ask them to write down what works, what doesn't and idea for change
3. Discuss and see where it goes, just like a normal retro
4. Set some actions into plan and execute them for next 1:1 meetings

What if it is your manager? Tell them you wanna experiment it. Share the format and find out what the real goal of the meeting (maybe he might have something else in mind)

Things that might wanna touch on - _frequency_, _time_, _location_, _agenda_, _goal_, _length_, _communication medium_, etc.

### Are you a good manager?

Try answer those.
1. **Can you take a week off?** Pay attention when you come back. Does people miss you? What do they need you for?
2. **Can problem be handled without you?** Congrats if they are. It means your team feel a sense of responsibility and ownership. You have clearly delegated to individuals.
3. **Does team deliver consistently?** Delivery is a good indicator for a healthy team. Healthy team ships code consistently.
4. **Do people tell you what they think?** The reality is that most leaders found that people being less candid with them. It is true, there is a power dynamic and not easy for someone to approach the leadership person. So the leader has to make effort and time to be available.
5. **Do people treat each other well?** Effective teams are inclusive. You need to cultivate a respectful environment on the team and you have to make sure that you will not tolerate discrimnatory words or behaviours.
6. **Is team self-improving?** Self improving team are open to discuss, listen to feedback and willing to change as part of their process.
7. **Can you give meaningful feedback?** It means you know enough insight into their work, accomplishments, struggles to be able to do it.
8. **Can you take work outside your scope?** If the team is in good order, it allows you to provide more support to those above and around.
9. **Do your peers come to you for advice?** If you are doing well and helpful, naturally people will be attracted to you.
